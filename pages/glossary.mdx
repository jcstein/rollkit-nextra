# Rollup Glossary

A glossary of terms to define different Rollup designs and terminology:

**Types of Rollup Designs:**
* [Basic Rollup](./glossary/basic-rollup)
* [Based Pessimistic Rollup](./glossary/based-pessimistic-rollup)
* [Pessimistic Rollup with a Shared Sequencer](./glossary/pessimistic-rollup-with-a-shared-sequencer)
* Pessimistic Rollup with Based and Shared Sequencing
* Based Rollup with a Centralized Sequencer
* Optimistic Rollup with a Centralized Header Producer
* Based ZK Rollup with a Decentralized Prover Market
* Based Rollup with a Header Producer Competition Maximizing Protocol MEV

**Terminology**:
* **Rollups** are blockchains that post their Transaction Data to another blockchain and inherit its consensus and data availability.
* **Sequencing** is the process of aggregation and header production.
* **Aggregation** is the process of batching transactions into one batch. A batch of transactions consists of one or more transactions.
* **Header production** is the process of creating the Rollup header backed by specific security properties.
* **Rollup Block** is a data structure representing the Blockchain at a certain height. It consists of **Rollup Data** and **Rollup Headers**.
* **Rollup Data** is either a batch of transactions or the state difference between transaction batches.
* **Rollup Header** is metadata about the block which at minimum includes a commitment to the transactions in that blocks. 
* **Inclusion** is the process by which a transaction is accepted into the blockchain.
* **Ordering** is the process of arranging transactions in a specific sequence in the blockchain.
* **Execution** is the process by which the transactions in the blockchain are processed and their effects are applied to the state of the blockchain.
* A **pessimistic rollup** is a rollup that only supports full nodes that replay all the transactions in the rollup to check its validity.
* A **based rollup** is a rollup that delegates aggregation to a DA-Layer.
